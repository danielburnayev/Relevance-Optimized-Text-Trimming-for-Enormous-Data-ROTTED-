Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that
ma

rs a
function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.
In supervised learning, each example is a

rvisory signal).
A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces 

etermine the class labels for unseen instanc

 This requires
the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen sit
